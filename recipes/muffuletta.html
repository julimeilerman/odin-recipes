        <h1>Muffuletta Sandwich</h1>
       <img id="muffuletta" src="../images/muffuletta.jpg">

       <h2 class="subtitle"><i>Description</i></h2>
        <p class="description">This hearty meal-in-one sandwich is stuffed with a marinated olive salad
         and savory Italian cold cuts. Before serving, it rests so the garlicky 
         oil in the salad seeps into the bread. The longer the sandwich rests 
         the better it gets, making it ideal for a make-ahead dinner, a picnic, 
         or in New Orleans, a parade route fare.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle"><i>Ingredients</i></h3>
        <h4>For the Salad</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small anchovy fillet, packed in oil</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil, for the marinade</li>
            <li>1 cup coarsely chopped pitted kalamata olives</li>

            <li>1/2 cup finely diced carrot (from 1 small carrot)</li>  
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped cauliflower florets</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons drained and chopped capers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh oregano or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>

        <h4>For the Sandwich</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8- to 9-inch) round, seeded muffuletta loaf</li>
            <li>4 ounces thinly sliced salami</li>
            <li>4 ounces thinly sliced capicola</li>
            <li>4 ounces thinly sliced mortadella</li>
            <li>4 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella cheese</li>

        <h3 class="subtitle"><i>Steps</i></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Mash the anchovies:</strong></p> 
                <p>In a small bowl, add the anchovy and 2 tablespoons 
                 olive oil. Use a fork to mash the anchovy until 
                 dissolved in the oil. I like to use a wooden bowl 
                 because I find it easier to mash the anchovy against 
                 its textured sides.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Add the vegetables and seasonings:</strong></p>
                <p>In a medium bowl, add the mashed anchovy with the oil, kalamata and green olives, celery, carrot, cauliflower, garlic, capers, red wine vinegar, oregano, and black pepper. Stir to combine.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Add olive oil and marinate:</strong></p>
                <p>Add enough olive oil to just cover the salad. For the best flavor, let it marinate for at least 1 hour at room temperature or overnight in the fridge.</p>
                <p>Stir the salad, taste, and add more black pepper or vinegar if youâ€™d like. It probably does not need more salt because the olives, anchovy, and capers are salty enough. </p>
                <p>You will have about 4 cups of olive salad, of which you will use about 2 cups in the sandwich. Think of the leftovers as a gift for tossing with pasta, to spoon over cream cheese for dipping, or to make another muffuletta! It will keep, covered in oil and refrigerated, for at least 1 month.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Prepare the bread:</strong></p>
                <p>Slice the loaf of bread in half horizontally and use your hands to hollow out each half by removing the soft bread inside. This will create cavities for the filling. Leave 1/2-inch of soft bread near the crust, taking care not to tear through the crust.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Spread the olive salad:</strong></p>
                <p>Stir the salad once more to reincorporate the oil and seasonings, then spread about 2 cups total on the 2 pieces of bread. Use the back of a spoon to really smoosh it down into the bread, covering the entire surface.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Assemble the meats and cheeses:</strong></p>
                <p>Layer the salami, capicola, mortadella, mozzarella, and provolone on the bottom piece of bread. Carefully flip the top piece of bread on top.</p>           
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Wrap it and let it rest:</strong></p>
                <p>Tightly wrap the muffuletta with foil and allow it to sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature for the flavors to marry and the oil to soak into the bread.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Serve:</strong></p>
                <p>Remove the foil and cut the muffuletta into 4 wedges and serve.</p>
                <p>Tightly wrap any leftover sandwich with plastic wrap or foil and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The leftover olive salad will keep for 1 month if covered with olive oil in a sealed container in the refrigerator.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
